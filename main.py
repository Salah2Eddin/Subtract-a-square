# Desc: This is a two-player mathematical
# game of strategy. It is played by two people with a pile of coins (or other
# tokens) between them. The players take turns removing coins from the pile,
# always removing a non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, â€¦). The
# player who removes the last coin wins.
